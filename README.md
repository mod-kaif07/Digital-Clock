# Local Time Display

This project is a simple web application that displays the **current local time** dynamically. The clock updates in real-time using JavaScript and provides an elegant design with modern UI aesthetics.

## Features
- Dynamically displays the local time in `HH:mm:ss` format.
- Modern and attractive design with CSS animations.
- Lightweight and responsive.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and modern design.
- **JavaScript**: For real-time time updates using `setInterval`.

## How It Works
The JavaScript code below updates the local time every second:
```javascript
const clock = document.getElementById("clock");
setInterval(() => {
    let date = (new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    clock.innerHTML = date;
}, 1000);
```
- The `setInterval` function is used to execute the update logic every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
- The `toLocaleTimeString` method ensures the time is displayed in the user's local format.
